                "description": "There are few things in life I love more than a fully loaded potato with sour cream, scallions, lots of cheese, and crispy bacon. Add that on top of another fluffy carb, and I’m in heaven. This recipe was inspired by the famous Sally’s Apizza, one of the most beloved makers of New Haven-style pizza. They have a Potato & Rosemary pie that I love. My take is a little more kid-friendly, thanks to the Cheddar cheese and bacon. The key is to cut the potatoes thinly and evenly so they have time to cook through in the oven. I like to cook this until the potatoes start to crisp a little on top, offering the best of both worlds: creamy and crunchy potatoes!",

Starting at the top of the bowl, use your wet hands to pull the top edge of the dough up and over the dough ball. Continue this process until you work your way all around the dough. This is known as a stretch and fold. It helps to develop gluten and replaces traditional kneading. Cover the bowl again and let sit in a warm spot.",
                  "After 30 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold process. Cover the bowl and perform two more sets of stretches and folds 30 minutes apart. After the 4th stretch and fold, cover the bowl and let sit for 30 minutes.",
                  "At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and should be smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be chilled overnight to use the next day.",
                  "For the toppings:Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.",

Dimple the surface again, then layer the potato slices on top. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with crumbled bacon.",

                  "Remove from the oven and let sit in the pan for about 10 minutes, then carefully slide focaccia onto a cutting board. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes, then sprinkle sliced scallions all over before slicing and serving."
